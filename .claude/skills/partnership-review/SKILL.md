## Red Flags to Identify

**Actively search for these issues and flag prominently:**

### High Risk (Escalate Immediately)
| Red Flag | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Unlimited liability exposure | You could be on the hook for everything |
| Joint and several liability | You pay for partner's mistakes too |
| Broad indemnification without caps | Unlimited financial exposure |
| Personal guarantees required | Your personal assets at risk |
| Automatic renewal without notice | Locked in without realizing |

### Medium Risk (Negotiate Before Signing)
| Red Flag | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| One-sided termination rights | They can exit, you cannot |
| Unclear IP ownership | Disputes over who owns what |
| Vague performance metrics | No clear success criteria |
| Hidden costs or obligations | Surprise expenses later |
| Broad non-compete clauses | Limits future business options |

### Structural Issues (Clarify Before Signing)
| Red Flag | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Missing exit clause | No clear way out |
| No dispute resolution | Expensive litigation if conflict |
| Perpetual license grants | Partner keeps using your IP forever |
| Vague scope | Scope creep and misaligned expectations |
| No confidentiality carve-outs | Cannot discuss with advisors |

## Florida-Specific Considerations

**When reviewing agreements governed by Florida law or involving Florida entities:**

### Relevant Florida Statutes

| Statute | Title | Key Provisions |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Chapter 605** | Florida Revised Limited Liability Company Act | LLC formation, operating agreements, member duties, dissolution |
| **Chapter 607** | Florida Business Corporation Act | Corporate governance, shareholder rights, director duties |
| **Chapter 620** | Florida Revised Uniform Partnership Act | Partnership formation, partner duties, dissociation, dissolution |
| **Chapter 617** | Florida Not For Profit Corporation Act | Nonprofit governance, member rights |
| **F.S. 542.335** | Non-compete agreements | Enforceability requirements: written, reasonable time/area/scope, legitimate business interest |
| **Chapter 501** | Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA) | Consumer protection, unfair methods of competition |
| **Chapter 682** | Florida Arbitration Code | Arbitration agreement requirements, enforcement |

### Florida Partnership-Specific Checklist

- [ ] **Registered Agent**: Florida requires a registered agent and registered office (F.S. 605.0113 for LLCs, F.S. 607.0501 for corps)
- [ ] **Annual Report**: Florida entities must file annual reports with Division of Corporations
- [ ] **Non-Compete Enforceability**: Florida courts enforce non-competes IF they meet F.S. 542.335 requirements:
  - Must be in writing and signed
  - Must protect a "legitimate business interest"
  - Must be reasonable in time, area, and scope
  - Presumptively reasonable: 6 months or less; presumptively unreasonable: 2+ years
- [ ] **Choice of Law**: If agreement specifies Florida law, Florida courts will generally honor this
- [ ] **Venue**: Specify county if litigation venue is important (Florida has 67 counties)
- [ ] **LLC Operating Agreement**: Florida allows great flexibility in LLC operating agreements (Chapter 605)
- [ ] **Partnership Dissolution**: Check for compliance with Chapter 620 dissolution and winding up procedures

### Florida Red Flags

| Issue | Florida-Specific Concern |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Non-compete without legitimate business interest | Likely unenforceable under F.S. 542.335 |
| Oral partnership agreement | Valid but proof issues; Florida prefers written |
| Missing registered agent | Entity may not be in good standing |
| Unreasonable non-compete duration (>2 years) | Presumptively unreasonable under F.S. 542.335 |
| No annual report filed | Entity may be administratively dissolved |
| Personal guarantee from LLC member | Pierces liability protection purpose of LLC |

### Florida Dispute Resolution Notes

- **Arbitration**: Florida Arbitration Code (Chapter 682) governs; federal FAA may also apply
- **Mediation**: Florida courts strongly encourage mediation; some circuits require it
- **Venue**: Can specify county; otherwise defaults to statutory venue rules
- **Attorney's Fees**: Florida allows fee-shifting provisions; prevailing party clauses common

Always recommend Corey consult with a qualified **Florida-licensed** attorney for:
